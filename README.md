## Option #1: Creating a User Interface I

### Assignment Instructions

Create a user interface that includes a top bar with a menu. The menu should have four items:

1. **Date and Time Display**: 
   - When the user selects the first menu option, the current date and time should be printed in a text box.

2. **Log Text to File**: 
   - When the user selects the second menu option, the contents of the text box should be written to a text file named `log.txt`.

3. **Change Background Color**:
   - When the user selects the third menu option, the frame background color should change to a random hue of the color green. 
   - The menu option should display the initial random hue each time it is selected for a single execution of the program. 
   - Refer to [W3Schools Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) for color selection.

4. **Exit Program**:
   - When the user selects the fourth menu option, the program should exit.

### Version Control

- Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments.
- GIT repositories should be established, and screen captures of the repositories should be submitted with each assignment.
